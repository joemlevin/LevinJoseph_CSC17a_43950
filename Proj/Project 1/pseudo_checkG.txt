copy answer to temp int array
initialize corNum, corPos to zero
loop for the contents of both guess and temp answer
	if guess[i]==temp[i], increment both counters and set temp[i] to -1
loop for contents of temp answer
	loop for contents of guess
		if temp[i]==guess[j] AND i!=j increment corNum and set temp[i] to -1
