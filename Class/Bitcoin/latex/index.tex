This is the developer documentation of the reference client for an experimental new digital currency called Bitcoin (\href{https://www.bitcoin.org/}{\tt https\+://www.\+bitcoin.\+org/}), which enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-\/to-\/peer technology to operate with no central authority\+: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.

The software is a community-\/driven open source project, released under the M\+I\+T license.\hypertarget{index_Navigation}{}\section{Navigation}\label{index_Navigation}
